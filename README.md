A Project to expand upon the NHL Leage Simulator App turning it into a working fantasy league style game. Users will be able to create their own team and select a starting roster from a large databse of available players. Results are simulated using Team Form, Player Form, Player Quality, and Time on Ice, ensuring that the better a team is playing the greater the chance of winning and vice versa.

Working:
    Database
    Game Logic
    

In Design:
    Front-End UI
    Player Transfer System
    Roster Line Management
